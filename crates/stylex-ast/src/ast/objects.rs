//! Operations on the own properties of an object literal.
//!
//! An object literal is a list of properties, and three questions get asked of
//! that list often enough to be answered once: what order does the language
//! enumerate it in, which properties does a later one replace, and what does
//! spreading one object into another produce. Every answer turns on which key a
//! property declares, so that reading is stated once here too.
//!
//! The first question is also asked of collections that are not property lists.
//! A `create` call collects its namespaces into an ordered map, and that map
//! stands for an object too, so it enumerates by the same rule. Both readers
//! share `own_key_rank` rather than each carrying an opinion about `+0`.
