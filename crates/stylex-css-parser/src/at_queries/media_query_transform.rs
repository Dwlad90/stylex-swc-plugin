/*!
Media query transformation functionality.

Implements the "last media query wins" transformation logic. This ensures proper
specificity handling when multiple media queries target the same properties.

This implementation provides media query transformation:
1. DFS traversal of the style object
2. At depth >= 1, apply negation-based media query transformation
3. Use pure AST manipulation, not range-based logic

/// three are contract:
///
/// - deleting and re-adding moves a key to the end, so the rewritten media keys
///   end up after every other property, in their own declaration order
/// - assigning a key that is already present keeps that key's position and
///   replaces only its value, so two entries canonicalizing to one query text
///   leave one rule, at the earlier position, holding the later value
/// - the value is read from the map at the moment its key is rewritten, not
///   collected beforehand, so an earlier rewrite that landed on a later key is
///   what that later key then carries
///
/// The second is the one an author notices: one of their declarations is absent
/// from the output. That is faithful rather than accidental, and nothing is
/// reported for it, because the reference implementation reports nothing. It is
/// a **ported upstream defect, not a design** -- see
/// [ADR 0001](../../docs/adr/0001-the-official-compilers-output-wins.md). When
