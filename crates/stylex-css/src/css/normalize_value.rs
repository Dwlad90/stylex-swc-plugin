//! Rewriting a declaration value into the canonical text that gets hashed.
//!
//! The value is scanned into a loose token list, a fixed list of small
//! transformations is folded over it in a fixed order, and the list is spelled
//! back out. Nothing else happens to it — which is the point. A token no pass
//! names survives byte for byte, so the author's hex spelling,
//! letter case, quote character and whitespace positions all reach the hash
//! exactly as written.
//!
//! ## The order is part of the behaviour
//!
//! [`normalize_timings`] runs before [`normalize_leading_zero`] so that a
//! duration converted from milliseconds to seconds is then stripped of its
//! leading zero: `100ms` becomes `0.1s` and then `.1s`. Reordering the two
//! produces `0.1s`, a different class name, and no error anywhere.
//!
//! The three detectors run first so that a value carrying an unfinished
//! construct, or a reference to a property that cannot exist, is rejected
//! before anything rewrites it — and among themselves in that order, so that
//! `var(foo`, which is unfinished *and* unprefixed, is reported as the
//! unfinished function it is. [`convert_font_size_to_rem`] runs last —
//! appended only when its option is on — so that the number it produces keeps
//! its leading zero.
//!
//! The caller's own injection guard runs *between* the first two detectors and
//! the third, which is where the sequence stops being an internal ordering and
//! becomes a compatibility one. An unclosed function and an unclosed string are
//! the two rejections the reference compiler also makes, so a value carrying
//! one of them and a declaration-terminating token is refused by both compilers
//! for the same reason rather than for whichever guard each spelled first. The
//! token guard still outranks the unprefixed custom property, which is this
//! compiler's rejection alone and has no second opinion to agree with.
//!
//! ## What is not here
//!
//! No pass understands hex colours, letter case or quote characters, so none of
//! them can alter those. Read the absence as deliberate: it is what makes two
//! compilers agree on a value neither of them has an opinion about.
//!
//! Exponent notation is not in that list. Every pass that re-spells a number
//! goes through `to_js_string`, which spells it the way JavaScript's
//! `Number::toString` does — so `0.0000001px` comes back as `1e-7px`, which is
//! what the reference compiler produces too.
