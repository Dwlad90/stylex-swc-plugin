//! Fixtures shared by the CSS test modules.
//!
//! Value normalization is asserted from more than one module — the general
//! coverage in `common_test`, and the harness-verdicted coverage in
//! `value_normalization_parity_test` and `spacing_repair_parity_test` — and all
//! of them need the same option objects, the same way of reading a rejection,
//! and the same way of recording a reference-compiler verdict. Kept here so a
//! change to how the compiler is configured, how it reports a rejection, or how
//! a verdict is spelled lands in one place.
//!
//! A case is built by one of two constructors: [`unchanged`] when the value
//! comes back as written, [`same`] when it is rewritten. Both carry the same
//! claim about the reference compiler — that it spells the value the way the
//! case says — because after the normalization pipeline was replaced there is
//! no value in the corpus the two compilers spell differently.
//!
//! There was a third, `diverges`, for a case the two disagreed on. It is gone
//! because nothing could construct it any more, and an empty vocabulary reads
//! as a claim that nothing was ever checked. A future divergence is not
//! recorded by reviving it: the harness is the oracle, and a case it reports as
//! divergent is a defect to fix, not a spelling to enshrine. Values the
//! compiler rejects have no spelling to compare and go through [`rejects`]
//! instead.
//!
//! Run this crate with `cargo nextest`. Under plain `cargo test` the sweeps
//! here route on the order of 140k caught panics through libtest's output
//! buffering, which takes minutes rather than seconds.
