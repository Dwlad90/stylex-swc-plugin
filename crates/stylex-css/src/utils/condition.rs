/// Whether a key opens a nested block rather than declaring a property.
///
/// Three prefixes do that, and they are one rule between them: a colon starts a
/// pseudo selector (`:hover`, `::before`), an `@` starts an at-rule
/// (`@media …`), and a `[` starts an attribute selector (`[data-active]`).
/// Anything else is a property name, and its value is a declaration.
///
/// Sites testing a *subset* of the three do not call this — the create-arg
/// walker and dynamic-style functions exclude attribute selectors, and pre-rule
/// nesting handles at-rules on a separate pass. Those omissions are load-bearing,
/// so widening them to this predicate would change behavior.
