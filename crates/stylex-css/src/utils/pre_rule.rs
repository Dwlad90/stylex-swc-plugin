/// how the pseudo side came to be sorted by bytes.
///
/// **Root collation is two passes, and neither is a byte comparison.** The
/// *primary* pass weighs each character by [`ASCII_PRIMARY_ORDER`]: whitespace,
/// then punctuation and symbols, then digits, then letters, with a letter's case
/// ignored -- so `:HOVER` weighs as `hover` and sorts after `:active`, and

/// because a key that runs out of characters has run out of primary weights:
/// `:a` precedes `:aB`, and the case difference further along is never read.
///
/// **The table is measured, and so is the whole comparator.** The order was read
/// out of `localeCompare` by sorting the printable ASCII characters with it, and
/// the table is now checked against root collation itself: every one of the 9 025
/// printable-ASCII pairs, the multi-character shapes the table settles with rules
/// of its own, and 20 000 random printable-ASCII key pairs -- every one of which
/// asserts, which the test also checks, because it used to draw from a
/// 431-character alphabet and skip every pair that crossed the fast path's
/// boundary. That left 36 rounds of the 20 000 asserting anything, and 20 of
/// those were single characters the exhaustive sweep already covered.
///
/// Crossing the boundary is a separate property, asserted separately: 500 random
/// mixed runs are sorted and checked to come out sorted, which is what an
/// intransitive comparator fails. `pre_rule_test.rs` holds both, along with the
/// pairs that decide the ordering; `stylex-transform`'s `nested_pseudo_ordering`
/// suite pins the class names they hash to.
///
/// **Everything else goes to root collation.** A control character, `DEL`, and
/// every non-ASCII character are handed to [`collating_pseudo_comparator`],
/// which is `icu_collator` at the root locale -- so an accented letter weighs
/// beside its base letter, a symbol weighs below every letter, and a character
/// root collation does not weigh at all carries no weight here either. That was
/// the last divergence in the parity harness costing a class name, and
/// `docs/adr/0001-root-collation-orders-a-non-ascii-key.md` holds the
/// numbers the choice was made on.
///
/// **The two paths must be one answer, and the boundary is `0x20..=0x7e`.** They
/// agree over every printable-ASCII pair, which is asserted rather than assumed.
/// The boundary is not `is_ascii()`: the table ranks a byte it does not name
/// above every byte it does, and root collation gives a control character no
/// weight, so a control character on the fast path yields `:ä` < `:z` <
/// `:\u{0002}` < `:ä`. A cycle, and a sort over a cycle may return anything.
///
/// **What stays uncovered.** Upstream calls `localeCompare` bare, so its answer
/// follows the build machine's default locale rather than root. Every locale
/// measured agrees with root on the accented letters an author is likely to
/// write, except Swedish and Danish, which sort `ö` after `z`. So this closes the
/// divergence for a build machine whose locale does not tailor the characters in
/// play, which is the only answer a compiler can give without reading its

  // **Printable** ASCII, and the word is load-bearing. The table ranks a byte it
