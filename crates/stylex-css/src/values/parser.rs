//! Cutting a shorthand value into the parts its expansion hands out.
//!
//! Ports `splitValue` from the reference compiler's
//! `shared/utils/split-css-value.js`. The one deliberate divergence is recorded
//! under "What holds of every part" below: an empty part is a part here, where
//! upstream throws.
//!
//! A shorthand assigns one authored value to several longhands, so something
//! has to decide where one part ends and the next begins. That decision is a
//! compatibility contract rather than a detail: each part becomes the value of
//! a generated declaration, and a declaration's text is what its class name is
//! hashed from. Cut in a different place and every longhand gets a different
//! class name — and in the worst case a value that is not a declaration at all.
//!
//! The cut is made on the [value scanner]'s node kinds, which is the same
//! answer the reference compiler reaches, and it is made there for a reason a
//! character test cannot reproduce: `/` and `:` end a part at the top level and
//! are ordinary characters inside a function, so `10px/1.5` is two parts while
//! `calc(100% / 3)` is one. Only a scanner that has already decided what is a
//! separator and what is inside a function can tell those apart.
//!
//! # What holds of every part
//!
//! Three rules, stated here because each of them has been got wrong once at a
//! call site that did not know it:
//!
//! 1. **A part is echoed, never re-spelled.** An escape stays an escape, a
//!    quote keeps the character it was written with, and a number keeps the
//!    digits it was typed with. That is why there is no number formatting and
//!    no identifier serialization in this file.
//! 2. **A trailing importance annotation belongs to every part, not to one.**
//!    See [`apply_importance`].
//! 3. **An empty part is a part.** See below.
//!
//! All three are enforced by there being one way to get a part —
//! [`split_value_parts`] — rather than by anything a part carries as a value.
//! It applies the importance fold before returning, it spells a part only by
//! echoing what the scanner read, and it never drops one. A part is a `String`
//! for that reason: a wrapper around it could hold no rule the single producer
//! is not already the choke point for.
//!
//! The fold has one path around it, and it costs nothing: a value nested past
//! the depth budget returns before the split, as the single part it was handed.
//! [`apply_importance`] is a no-op on one part — it needs a second to move an
//! annotation onto — so the value that skips it is the value it would have
//! returned unchanged.
//!
//! # An empty part is a part
//!
//! A comment contributes its inner text, and an unterminated comment or an
//! empty one has none. So `padding: '1px /*'` is two parts, the second empty —
//! and that second part is *present*. It occupies its position, it counts
//! toward the arity, and every consumer treats it as the part it is:
//!
//! - the four-sided view assigns it to a side, whose declaration then emits
//!   nothing, because a declaration whose value is empty is not emitted;
//! - the importance fold moves a trailing annotation onto it like any other
//!   part;
//! - `contain-intrinsic-size`'s fold joins it onto a preceding `auto`;
//! - `list-style` lets it occupy the slot it lands in, and refuses a value
//!   where that means two images.
//!
//! No consumer skips one and none reads one as absent. There is no reference
//! answer to copy: the reference compiler throws `Cannot read properties of
//! undefined (reading 'type')` on `padding: '1px /*'`, so parity cannot
//! arbitrate this shape and the decision is this compiler's to make. It is
//! settled this way because the reference compiler's own guards over a part list
//! ask whether a part is *absent* — a missing index — and no part of a split
//! value is ever absent. Reading empty as absent instead loses whatever the
//! position meant: it is what made `contain-intrinsic-size: 'auto /*'` size only
//! the width where the reference compiler sizes both.
//!
