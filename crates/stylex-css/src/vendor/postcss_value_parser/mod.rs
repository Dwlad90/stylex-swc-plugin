//! A loose CSS declaration-value scanner: words, spaces, separators, strings,
//! comments and functions, each keeping the characters the author typed.
//!
//! Third-party code. Copyright (c) Bogdan Chadkin <trysound@yandex.ru>,
//! `postcss-value-parser` v4.2.0 at revision `43ae6d3`. MIT licensed; the full
//! notice ships beside this module in `LICENSE`, and the behaviour here is that
//! library's, quirks and all.
//!
//! ## What it is for
//!
//! A StyleX class name is a hash of the canonical declaration text, and this
//! scanner's serialised output *is* that text. Its looseness is the point: a
//! token here is an arbitrary blob rather than a spec-conformant CSS token, so
//! a percentage, a signed dimension and a number in exponent notation are each
//! one token, and every character not deliberately rewritten survives byte for
//! byte — hex spelling, letter case, quote character, whitespace positions.
//!
//! It never fails and never rejects. Unclosed functions, unclosed strings and
//! unterminated comments are recorded as flags on the node they belong to,
//! which is what lets a value written in syntax newer than this compiler's
//! knowledge pass through unharmed.
//!
//! ## Where a round trip does not hold
//!
//! Serialising a freshly parsed value normally reproduces the input byte for
//! byte. `/*/` is the exception: the comment scan starts at the opening `/`
//! rather than past it, finds its `*/` terminator inside the `/*/` itself, and
//! so `/*/ x */` comes back as `/**/ x */`. Two more degenerate shapes push a
//! source offset one byte past the end of the input — an unclosed string, whose
//! invented closing quote extends the buffer offsets are measured against, and
//! a trailing backslash, which makes the word scan overshoot. All three are
//! deliberate: correcting any of them would change class names.
//!
//! ## Two differences from the JavaScript
//!
//! The word scanner's second `code === slash` test, guarded by `parent.type`,
//! sits behind an unguarded `code === slash` that already matched — it is dead,
//! and reaching it would throw on an undefined parent. It is left out rather
//! than reproduced as a latent panic.
//!
//! A walk callback is handed the node and its index, but not the list holding
//! it: Rust cannot lend out both at once. Nothing reads that third argument —
//! not the JavaScript's own tests, and not the normalizers, which reach the
//! list they want to restructure directly instead. [`walk`] spells out what
//! follows from that.
