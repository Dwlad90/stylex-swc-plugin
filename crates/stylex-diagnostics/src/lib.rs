#![cfg_attr(coverage_nightly, feature(coverage_attribute))]

//! How StyleX shows an author where a refusal happened.
//!
//! A code frame quotes the offending line back out of the file the author
//! wrote, which means finding that line again: what the compiler holds by then
//! is a rewritten tree whose positions belong to its own source map, not to the
//! text on disk. So the module is re-read, re-parsed into the frame's own map,
//! and searched -- for the expression itself, for the namespace key that names
//! it, or for the declaration of the binding the refusal is really about.
//!
//! All of it is best effort. Every lookup here sits behind a panic boundary and
//! degrades to "no code frame", because a compilation must never stop on
//! account of the aid that explains why it stopped.
