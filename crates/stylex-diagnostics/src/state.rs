/// never names the state manager, which would make the state crate and the
/// diagnostics depend on each other. `stylex_state` implements the trait on its
/// state manager; this crate only ever sees these questions.
///
/// What a diagnostic remembers is not among them: the span and
/// framed-declaration maps are the diagnostics' own, so they are a
/// [`DiagnosticMemo`] the state merely stores. What is left is the compilation
/// state a frame cannot reconstruct -- the file being transformed and the module
/// re-parsed from it.
///
/// Every parameter that takes this trait takes it by generic bound, never as
/// `dyn`. The source-map annotation path asks these questions once per style
/// namespace, so a vtable here would put an indirect call on a hot loop.
