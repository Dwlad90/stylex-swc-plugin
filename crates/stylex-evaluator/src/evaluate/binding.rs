  // specifier and one of these globals name the same binding, and a syntax
  // context cannot keep those two apart. The import now answers it, as it does
  // upstream — measured on both compilers as
  // `modules-1266-import-aliased-to-a-global-name`, which the reorder turns from
  // a divergence into agreement.
  //
  // The three names are ordinary bindings to the language, so the question is
  // which of the two this reference is — the global, or something in scope that
  // took the name over. The binding decides, and nothing below it does: the
  // step answers for all three names either way, and a reference that names a
  // binding never reaches the initializer read below.
  //
  // A binding that took one of these names over carries no value the evaluator
  // holds — the reference implementation reads `binding.hasValue`, which is step
  // 6, deliberately absent above and always false there — so there is nothing
  // to fold and the step refuses. That refusal is what turns a dynamic style's
  // parameter named `NaN` into an inline style: the value falls through to the
  // inline-style path, which is where the parameter comes from.
  //
  // The binding question is asked of the module being compiled, where upstream
  // asks the scope chain of whatever file the reference sits in. The two part
  // company on a reference read out of an *imported* file, whose bindings carry
  // a syntax context this module's pre-scan never saw: the name misses and the
  // global stands. It fails in the safe direction — a fold that should have
