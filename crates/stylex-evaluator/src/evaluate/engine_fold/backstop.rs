//! The two checks the printed source runs through, and the rewrite that puts
//! them there.
//!
//! The [guard](super::guard) answers every read and every call it can name from
//! the syntax. What it cannot name is a key that is a *value* — `o[k]`, where
//! `k` is a parameter or a name — because the key is only a string once the
//! engine has run. The language's own index operator then performs that read
//! under no rule of this compiler, and `({})['__proto__']['constructor']` walks
//! from a plain object to `Function`.
//!
//! So the printed source does not use the index operator for such a read. It
//! calls a reader that coerces the key, compares it against the one table the
//! guard reads, and throws the guard's own sentence — the same rule, applied
//! where the name finally exists.
//!
//! A caller stands behind the reader. It refuses the language's `Function`, the
//! three constructors that inherit directly from it, and `eval`, whatever route
//! produced them. Two guards rather than one is the point: a reader alone is
//! one unknown gadget away from an escape, and the gadget is exactly the one
//! nobody has found yet. The reference implementation ships both for the same
//! reason.
//!
//! The caller stands in front of one calling shape: a call through a name the
//! printed source itself binds. That is not a shortcut, it is the whole set. A
//! value the engine produced is invoked in one of three ways. Through a member
//! — where the method name is spelled out and the guard already read it, and
//! `call`, `apply`, `bind` and `constructor` are refused by name. Through an
//! expression the guard does not admit as a callee at all. Or through a name —
//! and a name is either bound inside the printed source, which is the shape
//! the escape used, or free. A free name is a parameter of the printed arrow,
//! holding a value or a function this compiler carried, or one of the globals
//! the guard lets stand free, which is the applied-global allowlist. Neither
//! can be a function that compiles code.
//!
//! So a call through a free name keeps the language's own call, and
//! `String(x)` costs what it always cost. If the guard is ever taught to leave
//! a new kind of name free, that reasoning has to be read again.
//!
//! Both are **parameters of the printed arrow**, not globals. A global is a
//! name the printed source could point somewhere else. A parameter is neither
//! reachable nor shadowable: the guard refuses a binding that spells one of
//! these two names, so nothing between the arrow and the read can stand in
//! front of it.
//!
//! `docs/adr/0010-the-printed-fold-reads-and-calls-through-a-check.md` carries
//! the argument.
