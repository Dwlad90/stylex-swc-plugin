//! What the engine answered, read back as the value the evaluator carries.
//!
//! The fold's own suites read a stylesheet, which can only show what an
//! expression came to. These read the walk out itself: a value built in an
//! engine of the case's own, handed to the walk, and named by the expression it
//! comes back as.
//!
//! Two things need the walk asked directly rather than through a source. An
//! array is spelled one way at the top of an answer and another under an object
//! key, and one case has to be able to say both. And several steps of the walk
//! read a value the way the language reads it — an own-key list, a property, an
//! array's `length` — so each can throw, while no answer a shipped fold produces
//! can make one of them throw. A value the walk was handed rather than one it
//! grew is the only thing that reaches those, and they stay because the walk is
//! total over the value it is given.
//!
//! Every case names the expression or the sentence it expects. A case that said
//! only that something crossed would pass against a walk that answered anything.
