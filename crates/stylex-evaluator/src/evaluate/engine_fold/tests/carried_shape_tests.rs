//! What one value costs to cross, and what it comes to on the other side.
//!
//! The fold's own suites read a stylesheet, which can only show what an
//! expression came to. These read the carriage itself, in the two directions it
//! runs: the walk that measures a value before there is an engine, and the walk
//! that builds the engine's own values once there is one.
//!
//! Both are asked directly rather than through a source, because the walk
//! accepts more shapes than a source can hand it. Every value that crosses today
//! is one the evaluator answered, and the evaluator writes every object it
//! answers with identifier keys — so the reader's other two key spellings, and
//! several of the shapes that stop a crossing, have no source at all to be
//! written in. They keep the reader total over the tree it is given, which is
//! what a case has to say for them.
//!
//! Every case says the value or the sentence it expects, and each refusal names
//! the reason it is one — a shape the bridge writes no form of is handed back
//! to the dispatch that owns it, where a value past a bound is a rule that
//! fired and carries words for the author.
