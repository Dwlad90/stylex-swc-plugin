//! What the engine answers for a source it cannot be built from, for one it
//! cannot parse, and for a read of it that throws.
//!
//! Every step here refuses, and none of the refusals can fire from what the
//! compiler hands in: the prelude is a constant, the traps are assembled from
//! two more, and a printed expression comes from a tree the parser already
//! accepted once. So each case hands the step a source of its own, which is the
//! same route [`var_group_tests`](super::theme::var_group_tests) takes to the
//! four refusals of the traps.
//!
//! The refusals stay rather than being deleted as unreachable, because what
//! keeps them unreachable is a constant somebody may rename — and a rename that
//! breaks one is a refusal here rather than a fold answering a wrong value.
