//! What a `defineVars` group behaves like once it is inside the engine.
//!
//! The fold's own tests read a stylesheet, which can only show what an
//! expression came to. These read the value itself: a group answers a member it
//! never stored, holds none of them, says what it is, and nests exactly where the
//! guard said it does. Each is asked the way the printed source would ask it —
//! by running JavaScript against the value — rather than through an accessor of
//! this module's own.
//!
//! Below them are the cases about the module rather than the group: what a
//! source of traps has to be before it can build one, and what each reading
//! answers for a value that is not a group at all. Neither has a stylesheet to
//! be written in, so each asks the function directly.
