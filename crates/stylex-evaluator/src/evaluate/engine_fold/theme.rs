//! A `defineVars` group as a value the engine can read members off.
//!
//! The group is not a table of members. Any name read off it answers a variable
//! derived from the group's own identity — the file and export that declare it —
//! which is why this compiler holds it as a reference rather than as a map, and
//! why it used to cross into the engine as nothing more than the string its own
//! `toString` answers. A string has none of the group's members, so every
//! expression that read one was handed back — and once the whole of
//! `Array.prototype` belonged to the fold there was nothing below to hand it
//! back to.
//!
//! What the language has for a value whose members are answered rather than
//! stored is a proxy, so that is what crosses. The identity travels as the four
//! plain values a member's name is derived from, and one Rust function derives
//! it — the same one [`ThemeRef::get`](
//! stylex_state::theme_ref::ThemeRef::get) calls, so the engine and
//! the evaluator cannot come to answer the same read differently.
//!
//! The traps are written in JavaScript rather than assembled here because the
//! `toString` a group needs is a closure over the group's hash, and the engine's
//! safe surface builds native functions from plain function pointers, which
//! capture nothing.

/// the language asks a value for that text. A key that is not a string is not a
/// member name at all. Everything else is a member, which is what makes a group a
/// proxy rather than an object — the member nobody wrote down answers exactly as
/// the one somebody did.
///
/// A group whose members are themselves groups is one *token* per dotted path
/// rather than a read of a read: `colors.brand.primary` names `brand.primary`.
/// Which paths those are is a question about the source and not about any value,
/// so the guard answers it and hands the prefixes down — a key it named stands in
/// for the path so far, and every other key answers the variable its path names.

/// off a *value* the expression produced still answers a string.
