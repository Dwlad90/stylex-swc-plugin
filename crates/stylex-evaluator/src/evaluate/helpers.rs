/// the evaluator answers both itself, so a chain that doubles its own result was
/// bounded by no number at all -- and the *depth* budget, which is what stopped
/// it, limits how far a walk descends rather than how large a value gets.
///
/// The bound sits on the growth rather than on what a binding ends up holding,
/// which is the other place it could have gone. Three things decide it. An inline
/// `(a + a).length` allocates exactly as much and no binding holds the result, so
/// a bound on bindings would miss the same string written one way. The growth is
/// where the memory is spent, so refusing there refuses *before* the next
/// doubling allocates rather than after. And a long string a binding merely holds
/// is one allocation the author asked for -- what turns a typo into gigabytes is
/// compounding, and only the growth site sees it.
///
