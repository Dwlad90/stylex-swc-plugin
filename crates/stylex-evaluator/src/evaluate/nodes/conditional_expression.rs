  // copy beside it drifted, and called `NaN` true where `NaN || x` called it
  // false. And a value with no expression form is still a value with a
  // truthiness: the evaluator spells an array as its own vector and a folded
  // namespace as a function map, and every one of those stands for an object,
  // which is truthy whatever it holds. Requiring an expression form here
  // refused `[] ? a : b` on a test the language has no doubt about.
  //
  // A value with no truthiness at all refuses, as it does under `!`, `typeof`
  // and the numeric operators. It is the value an array holds where an element
  // folded to nothing, and an index read hands it back on its own -- so this
  // arm is entered from a source rather than argued about.
  //
  // Read as `false` instead, `[<nothing>][0] ? 'red' : 'blue'` folded to the
  // alternate arm and wrote a colour the source does not describe. The value
  // means "nothing resolved this", which has no arm to name.
