//! The conversions a global names, applied to a value the engine was not handed.
//!
//! `String(x)`, `Number(x)`, `Object(x)` and `Array(x)` are native JavaScript
//! functions, and the [fold](super::super::engine_fold) answers them by calling
//! them — which is why there is no table of conversions here standing in for the
//! language.
//!
//! What is here is the set of arguments the engine cannot answer for. Its bridge
//! carries JavaScript values, and this compiler has values of its own. The
//! injected function map and the environment object have no JavaScript form at
//! all, so they never cross and every call over one arrives here.
//!
//! A resolved theme reference does cross, as a stand-in the engine reads members
//! off, so `String(group)` and `group.token` both fold there. What arrives here
//! is the one answer that *is* the group again — `Object(group)` hands its
//! argument straight back — since the group's members live in another file and
//! no expression this side writes stands for it.
//!
//! This answers all of them with the same coercions `+` and an interpolation
//! already use, so a coerced theme reference cannot come to read one way here
//! and another there.
//!
//! Upstream folds every one of these, and a build that refused them would name a
//! class the other build defines.
