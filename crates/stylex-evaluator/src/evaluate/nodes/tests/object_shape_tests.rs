//! What an object literal folds to, key shape by key shape.
//!
//! Every key an object can be written with becomes a string, and the *same*
//! reader decides whether two keys collide -- so a spelling read one way here
//! and another there is how one property comes to be two in the stylesheet.
//! That is why a number key is rendered as JavaScript spells a number rather
//! than as Rust does: `{ 1e21: x }` names the property `"1e+21"`.
//!
//! Every case is read past a declined fold, because an object the engine can
//! read is folded there. `sx.missing ?? <object>` is that shape: the engine
//! declines the name it cannot carry, and the object behind the `??` is what
//! this evaluator then folds.
