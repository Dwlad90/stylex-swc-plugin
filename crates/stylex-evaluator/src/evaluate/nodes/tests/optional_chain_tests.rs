//! What `?.` answers.
//!
//! The form asks one question before it reads anything: is the base there. A
//! base that is `null` or `undefined` makes the whole chain answer nothing,
//! and every other base is read exactly as the same expression without the
//! question mark would be read. Both halves are pinned here, in both the
//! member and the call spelling, because a chain that stopped early on a base
//! that *is* there would silently drop a declaration the author wrote.
//!
//! **This compiler folds a chain the reference implementation refuses.**
//! `@stylexjs/babel-plugin` 0.19.0 has no `Optional` handling at all and
//! answers `Unsupported expression: OptionalMemberExpression` for every base,
//! so `({ color: 'red' })?.color` gives CSS here and stops a build there. A
//! deliberate parting rather than the specification, recorded as ticket 50 of
//! `.scratch/split-transform-crate`.
