//! What the amplification guard reads a bound off, one shape of receiver at a
//! time.
//!
//! [`amplified_call_tests`](super::amplified_call_tests) asserts that the
//! arithmetic admits the calls a stylesheet is written with. This suite is
//! about the reading *under* that arithmetic: the guard has to see a count, a
//! width and a magnitude before it can multiply anything, and each of the
//! shapes below is a different way of seeing one.
//!
//! Two of those shapes cannot be written down directly, which is why they have
//! a suite of their own:
//!
//! - **An array the evaluator hands back as the literal it was written as.** An
//!   array written straight down folds to the evaluator's own list, so the arm
//!   that reads a written `ArrayLit` is reached only through a value that
//!   carries one -- `({ a: [1, 2] }).a`, where the member read answers the
//!   property's own node.
//! - **A value a name holds.** A receiver and a count are each resolved through
//!   the module when they are not written in place, so a case about that
//!   resolution has to bind the name.
