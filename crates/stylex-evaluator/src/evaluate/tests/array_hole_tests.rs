//! A written array hole, and everything next to it that must not move.
//!
//! `[, 1]` writes two slots and holds one element. The evaluator used to drop
//! the hole, so the array folded one element short of what the source says --
//! `height: [, '2px']` emitted `height: 2px`, and a `length` read through a
//! binding answered one. Neither errored. So the array now refuses, with the
//! reference implementation's own words for a hole: it evaluates element paths
//! and a hole's path carries no node.
//!
//! The suite is two-sided, because refusing every array would satisfy the first
//! half alone. Each refusal is paired with the fold beside it that has to keep
//! working: a trailing comma is punctuation rather than a slot, and a `length`
//! written on a literal receiver is still counted from the source -- the one
//! reading that answers what the language says.
