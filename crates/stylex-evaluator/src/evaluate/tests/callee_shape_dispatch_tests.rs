//! Which of the three callee shapes a call is read as, and what happens to a
//! call that is none of them.
//!
//! `admit_call` matches the callee and hands the call to the helper for its
//! shape: an applied global, a name, or a method. Only the third carries rules
//! of its own, so the match itself is where a call can be sent to the wrong set
//! of rules -- and a call sent to the wrong helper does not fail loudly. It
//! folds, to whatever the other shape's rules answer.
//!
//! So each shape is pinned by an answer only its own helper produces, and the
//! shapes that match none of them are pinned as refusals. The distinctions are
//! deliberately awkward ones: a name in parentheses is still a name, a
//! parenthesised member is still a method, and a computed key that reads as a
//! literal is still not one.
