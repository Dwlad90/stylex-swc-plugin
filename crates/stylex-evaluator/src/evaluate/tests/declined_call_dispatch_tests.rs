//! The call the engine declined, answered by the dispatch below it.
//!
//! Every call the engine can fold is folded there, so what reaches this
//! dispatch is a call over something the engine has no value for -- one of the
//! compiler's own functions, a name nothing binds, a receiver with no
//! JavaScript form. Each of those is answered by an arm of its own, and each
//! arm owes a sentence: a call that fell to the terminal refusal would tell an
//! author only the node kind they wrote.
//!
//! An argument nothing binds is what puts most of these cases here. It is the
//! smallest thing that makes the engine decline while leaving the callee and
//! receiver exactly as the case wrote them, so the arm under test is the one
//! that answers.
