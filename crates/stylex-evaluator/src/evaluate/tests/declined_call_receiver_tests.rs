//! How the dispatch below the engine reads the receiver of a call.
//!
//! A call the engine folded never reaches this dispatch, so every case here has
//! to make the engine decline first and leave the receiver exactly as it was
//! written. Two shapes do that: an argument nothing binds, and a value with no
//! JavaScript form -- one of the compiler's own functions -- sitting beside the
//! receiver's own properties.
//!
//! What the dispatch then reads is the receiver's *value*, and the three ways
//! that reading can go are the subject: a value it can apply, a value it can
//! name but not call, and no value at all while the walk is still confident.
