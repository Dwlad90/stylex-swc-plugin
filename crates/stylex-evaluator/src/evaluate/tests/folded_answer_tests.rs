//! What the engine answered, read back as a value the evaluator carries.
//!
//! The two allocation ceilings are the subject. The engine aliases, so one
//! string referenced a thousand times costs it one string; this side copies, so
//! the same answer is a thousand strings and a syntax node each. Nothing on the
//! way in bounds that, because nothing on the way in wrote it: the source of
//! `['abcd', 'efgh'].map((s) => s)` names no value at all, and the two strings
//! are the engine's own. So the counting is here, and it runs as the answer is
//! read.
//!
//! Beside them sit the two readings that need the engine while the answer is
//! being read: a property whose getter runs, and a value this side writes no
//! expression for.
//!
//! Every case names the number it is about rather than building an answer large
//! enough to pass the shipped one, and every refusal is paired with the same
//! shape inside the bound -- a ceiling case that refuses at every size says
//! nothing about the ceiling.
