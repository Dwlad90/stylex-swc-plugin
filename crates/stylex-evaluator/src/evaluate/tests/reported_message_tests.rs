//! What the evaluator writes to the log when it declines to fold something.
//!
//! A `log` macro reads its arguments only when a logger asked for that level,
//! so every message below is unexecuted code in an ordinary build and in every
//! other suite here — the refusal is asserted, and the sentence the author is
//! meant to read beside it is not. These cases install a logger, run the same
//! shapes those suites run, and read the messages back.
//!
//! Each case names the words it expects rather than only counting the
//! messages. A message that said nothing about the expression would satisfy a
//! count and tell an author nothing, which is the mistake worth catching here.
