//! Evaluating one expression written as source, and asserting what came back.
//!
//! Every suite that asks the evaluator about author-written syntax needs the
//! same four steps — parse, evaluate under fresh globals, decide whether the
//! answer is a fold or a refusal, and say which value it is. One copy, because
//! two suites asserting "this refuses" through separately maintained helpers is
//! how one of them comes to accept a refusal with no reason.
//!
//! What is not about source -- the two thread sizes, the nested literal, the
//! thread a case runs on and the parser itself -- comes from
//! [`scaffolding`](crate::tests::scaffolding) and is re-exported here, because
//! the stack suite needs the same five and two copies of a thread size is how
//! they come to disagree about what "large" means.
//!
//! [`folded_in_a_module_binding`] is the other thing two suites need: an
//! expression that resolves no name is printed with no parameters, so a case
//! about what the transport carries has to evaluate against a module that binds
//! something.
