//! What a template literal writes for the value it interpolates.
//!
//! Interpolation is `ToString` rather than "is this a literal the evaluator
//! recognises". Every value the language has a string for contributes that
//! string, so `${null}`, `${true}`, `${[1, 2]}` and `${{}}` each write what a
//! browser would write -- and none of them contributes the empty string, which
//! is what declared a value the author never wrote and hashed a class name to
//! match it.
//!
//! The one value with no string at all is a function. It is refused rather than
//! answered: the reference implementation writes the source text of its own
//! evaluator closure there, which is an internal artifact with no business in a
//! stylesheet.
