//! What the prefix operators answer.
//!
//! `void`, `typeof`, `!`, `+`, `-` and `~` each read their operand a different
//! way, and three of them read it without folding it at all. Every answer here
//! is the language's own, so a declaration written with one folds to what a
//! browser would have computed.
//!
//! The values the evaluator holds of its own -- an array as its own list, the
//! compiler's function fold -- have no expression form, and each operator has
//! to read one anyway: they all stand for an object or a function upstream, so
//! `typeof` and `!` answer for them rather than refusing.
