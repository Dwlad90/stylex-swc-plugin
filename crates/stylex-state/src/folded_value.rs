//! What a folded expression holds, in the kind JavaScript gives it.
//!
//! "Folded" and not "evaluated", because
//! [`EvaluateResultValue`](crate::evaluate_result_value::EvaluateResultValue)
//! already carries the second name in this crate and answers a different
//! question: it is what the evaluator hands back, and this is the kind one
//! value of it turned out to be.
//!
//! Two callers read the same thing. A `props` call is given a plain object and
//! keeps the kind of every declaration in it, and a `defineConsts` call keeps
//! the kind of every constant. The reference implementation writes both back
//! through one function, so they are read through one here.
//!
//! It sits beside the value it builds rather than beside either caller, and
//! beside the JSON spelling of that value, which is the same reading in the
//! other direction.
