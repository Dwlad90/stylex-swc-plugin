#![cfg_attr(coverage_nightly, feature(coverage_attribute))]

//! The state one file is compiled against, and the vocabulary it composes.
//!
//! [`state_manager::StateManager`] carries everything the compiler learns about
//! a single file -- its imports, its top-level expressions, the styles it has
//! injected, the modules it has already parsed -- and answers the questions the
//! phases above ask of it. It is one struct with one method surface on purpose.
//!
//! The other modules are the value types it holds or hands back. They live here
//! and not lower down because they name each other and the state manager in a
//! knot that cannot be cut: a function config carries a theme reference, a theme
//! reference reads the state manager, and an evaluated value can be a function
//! config. Nothing here knows how a value is *evaluated*, and nothing here
//! resolves a name against the declarations it records; both are crates above.
