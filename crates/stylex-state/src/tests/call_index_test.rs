//! Which member expressions are the callee of a call the module still holds.
//!
//! Asked once per member the visitor meets, so the answer has to stay exact
//! while calls are rewritten under it: a member kept after its last call was
//! replaced would make the visitor treat a plain property read as a call, and
//! one forgotten while a call still holds it would do the opposite.
