//! The shape every bound a project can raise takes: a default, an environment
//! override, and a limit past which neither is honoured.
//!
//! Each such bound is a number that turns a crash into a diagnostic, and the
//! right value depends on what a project generates rather than on anything the
//! compiler can know. What is *not* per-bound is how the number is chosen --
//! the precedence between an option and the environment, the parse, and the
//! clamp are the same question three times. They are answered once here, so a
//! ceiling is a declaration of what it bounds and nothing else.
