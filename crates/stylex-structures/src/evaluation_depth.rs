//! The evaluator folds a nested expression recursively. Without a ceiling its
//! real limit is the thread's stack, and its failure a process abort rather than
//! a diagnostic -- so the ceiling is not a tuning knob so much as the thing that
//! turns a crash into a message. It is configurable because the right number
//! depends on what a project generates, not on anything the compiler can know.
//!
//! How the number is chosen -- option, then environment, then default, clamped
//! to the limit -- is [`Ceiling`]'s, which the two allocation ceilings in
//! [`crate::fold_ceilings`] share.

/// levels of nesting in the source: reading a member descends to the object and
/// then to the value under the key, an array element costs the array as well,
/// resolving a reference descends into what it was bound to, and a parenthesis
/// costs nothing because it is unwrapped before the fold is asked.

/// a new name. The fold claims its stack up front, at a measured cost per level,
/// so the largest segment worth asking an operating system for is what sets
/// this: eight thousand levels at sixty-four kilobytes each is half a gigabyte
/// of address space.
///
/// It is a ceiling on what the *fold* will be asked for, not a promise about

/// does not survive being parsed in the first place -- the parser recurses
