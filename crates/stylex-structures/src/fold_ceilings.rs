//! The two ceilings on what one fold may allocate, and where their values come
//! from.
//!
//! The engine a fold runs on bounds loop iterations, recursion and VM stack.
//! What none of them bound is allocation: growth inside a native builtin is not
//! a counted loop, so `'x'.repeat(200000000)` is a typo that agrees with the
//! language and reaches gigabytes of resident memory. A compiler that dies there
//! is worse than one that declines, which is what these two turn it into.
//!
//! Two rather than one, because a value costs in two ways that do not stand in
//! for each other. A bounded string can still become one element per code unit,
//! which costs far more as a tree than it did as text; and a thousand empty
//! arrays hold no text at all and are still a thousand values to build. Each
//! bounds both directions of the bridge -- what a resolved name copies in, and
//! what an answer carries back -- because it is the same size measured on the
//! two sides.
//!
//! Configurable for the reason the [evaluation
//! depth](crate::evaluation_depth) is: the value that keeps a build reporting
//! rather than dying is a property of what a project generates, and the compiler
//! cannot know it. The precedence is [`Ceiling`]'s, and the same one.
