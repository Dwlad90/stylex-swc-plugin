//! Merges compiled style objects into one class name, the way the StyleX
//! runtime does: last write wins on the underlying CSS property, with an
//! inline-style fallback for anything not compiled.
//!
//! Third-party work. Copyright (c) Nicolas Gallagher,
//! [`styleq`](https://github.com/necolas/styleq). MIT licensed; the full notice
//! ships beside this crate in `LICENSE`, and the repository's
//! [`NOTICE.md`](../../NOTICE.md) lists it alongside everything else here that
//! somebody else wrote.
//!
//! The algorithm is the runtime's, reproduced so that the merge can happen at
//! compile time — the bundle then carries a literal class string instead of a
//! call. Its behaviour has to match the runtime's exactly, so this is left
//! reading the way the original does rather than idiomatised.
