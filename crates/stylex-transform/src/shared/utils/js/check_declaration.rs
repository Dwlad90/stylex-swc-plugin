/// The tail of the reference chain (`evaluate-path.js:685-690`, 0.19.0): a name
/// whose binding holds no initializer to fold is refused for the kind of
/// declaration it names, or for naming nothing this compiler can resolve.
///
/// The two arms report against different nodes, and upstream's do too. A
/// declaration kind is refused where upstream refuses it — inside
/// `evaluateCached` over the node `path.resolve()` handed back, which is the
/// declaration — so its frame names the `function` or `class` line. Measured on
/// 0.19.0, `create({ x: { color: f } })` under `function f() {}` frames the
/// declaration and carries a caret over the whole of it. `UNDEFINED_CONST` is
/// upstream's one refusal on the reference itself (`:687`), because by then
/// there is no declaration to name: the reference resolved to itself.
///
/// Takes the kind already resolved rather than the lists to search. The refusal
/// writes to the state, and a `&[Ident]` borrowed out of it cannot be held open
/// across that write -- so passing the lists meant cloning both of them, on a
/// path the comment there called rare and which is in fact how every dynamic
/// style's parameter is detected. A `DeclarationType` borrows nothing.
