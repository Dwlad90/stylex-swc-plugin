//! What crosses into the engine, and what it costs to carry.
//!
//! A name the guard resolved becomes a parameter of the printed arrow and its
//! value an argument to it, so a value travels *beside* the printed source
//! rather than inside it. This is that carriage: the shapes a value crosses as,
//! the two counts that bound them, and the last step into the engine's own
//! values, taken once there is an engine to build them in.
//!
//! Everything that can refuse refuses while the value is being measured, before
//! anything is printed or built — so the conversion with the engine in hand only
//! builds. Two walks, therefore, and one walk written once: the first produces
//! nothing at all and so copies nothing, the second produces the engine's own
//! values. What the two would otherwise have to agree about — which shapes the
//! bridge carries — is the kind of agreement this module exists to remove, so
//! they are one traversal under two [carriages](Carriage).
