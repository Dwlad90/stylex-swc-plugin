//! The StyleX functions the compile-time engine is allowed to call.
//!
//! The [folded function map](../../../../../CONTEXT.md#folded-function-map) is
//! not JavaScript: its values are this compiler's own Rust functions, and most
//! of them answer by writing into the build — `keyframes` injects a rule and
//! hands back the name it hashed. Carrying the map into the engine as a value
//! was measured and rejected for exactly that reason.
//!
//! One of them answers from its arguments and nothing else. `firstThatWorks`
//! reorders the fallbacks it was handed and folds the CSS variables among them
//! into one `var()` chain, touching no state on the way, so there is nothing to
//! stop the engine running it — and nothing an author could reach through it
//! that they could not reach by calling it directly. It travels as a function of
//! the engine's own, built over the same [shared
//! core](../../../../transformers/stylex_first_that_works.rs) the evaluator's
//! own path calls, so the two cannot come to answer differently.
//!
//! What that buys is a callback: `a.map(x => firstThatWorks(x, 'serif'))` is
//! one JavaScript call per element, which is the engine's job and not this
//! compiler's. Every other StyleX function stays where it was — the fold hands
//! its call back, and the dispatch behind the fold calls it as it always has.
