//! The stack every walk that recurses on the bare thread stack runs on.
//!
//! Several descents recurse without a frame budget of their own: the evaluator's
//! own, the guard's walk into an expression on its way to the engine, the
//! carriage of a resolved value inward, the conversion of an engine value back,
//! the printing of the source the engine is handed, and the engine's parse of
//! it. Overflowing any of them aborts the process from inside an evaluation
//! whose whole contract is that it may fail, so none of them may run on whatever
//! the thread happened to have left over.
//!
//! Two ways of asking, and one rule that decides which a descent gets: **a
//! descent that can ask again at the next level does**. Every walk this compiler
//! owns can, so each spends a level and claims room for the one after it, and a
//! walk that stops early pays for the levels it actually descended. The two that
//! cannot are the ones this compiler does not write: SWC's printer clones the
//! expression and writes it out, and the engine's parser reads it back, and both
//! descend through a nested literal on whatever stack they were handed. So the
//! fold claims their whole descent up front, around them and around nothing
//! else, and sizes that claim from how deep the text they are handed actually
//! nests — see [`nesting_of`].
