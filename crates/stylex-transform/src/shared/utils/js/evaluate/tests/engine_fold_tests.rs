//! What the engine-backed fold accepts, and — the part that matters — what it
//! refuses.
//!
//! An engine folds whatever JavaScript folds, so the guard in front of it is
//! the whole of this module's behaviour: everything it lets through is answered
//! by `String.prototype` and friends rather than by anything here, and
//! everything it holds back is a boundary somebody decided on. A test that only
//! checked the folds would pass while the guard let the scope, a mutation or a
//! value the evaluator cannot carry through.
//!
//! Refusals are asserted as refusals, not as absences: `assert_deopts` requires
//! the evaluator to answer "not confident" without aborting, which is the
//! property issue 02 established and this hook must not undo.
