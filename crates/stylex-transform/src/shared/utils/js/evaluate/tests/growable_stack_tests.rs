//! What the two ways of asking for stack actually give a walk.
//!
//! Neither is testable through the compiler at the size it is sized for: the
//! stages around the fold run out of room on an input long before the largest
//! configurable ceiling is reached, so a case written as source measures those
//! stages rather than these claims. And under-sizing either one does not report
//! — it aborts the process — so a suite that never asked for the largest claim
//! would be finding out on somebody's build.
//!
//! So the recursion here is written rather than parsed: a frame of a known size,
//! repeated a known number of times, is the only thing that can be pointed at a
//! specific number of bytes.
