//! Whether a reference reads its declarator's initializer, decided by position.
//!
//! Declarations are collected module-wide with no notion of where they sit, so
//! a reference above its own declaration used to fold to the initializer and
//! emit CSS for a value the program does not hold yet. The comparison that
//! fixes it reads the parser's byte positions — which is why the two cases
//! worth pinning hardest are the ones with no position to read. A synthesized
//! node carries `DUMMY_SP`, so it sorts before every authored declarator and
//! would be refused for having no position rather than for being early. No
//! source text can spell that pair, so the suites that go through a parser
//! cannot reach it; these tests assemble it directly.
