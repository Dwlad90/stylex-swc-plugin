//! Where a name is *declared*, found in the module a code frame reads from.
//!
//! A refusal about a binding is a refusal about its declaration: that is the
//! line the author has to go and change, and the line `@stylexjs/babel-plugin`
//! frames, because it deopts on `binding.path` rather than on the reference
//! (`utils/evaluate-path.js:626,647,653,657,661,665,673`, 0.19.0). Reporting the
//! read instead sends the reader to a line that is correct as written.
//!
//! What makes this a module of its own rather than a span threaded through the
//! evaluator is that the position cannot be carried. A `Span` produced by the
//! compiler's own parse indexes the compiler's source map; the code frame owns a
//! different one, built from the text it registered for the file — which may be
//! the file on disk or the compiled module printed back out. The same byte
//! offset means something else in each. So the frame is given a *name* and finds
//! the declaration in the module it already re-parsed, which is the same trade
//! `key_span_index` makes for namespace keys: an identifier survives the
//! value-level transforms an expression does not.
