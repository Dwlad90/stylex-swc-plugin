/// The reference builds the map again for every call, so keeping one for the
/// file rests on two conditions. Both hold, and both are named here because

///
/// - **Every import is recorded before the first call folds.** The map names
///   the helpers under each local name an import gave them, and `Discover`
///   records every import of the module before `TransformProducers` folds
///   anything, so no name arrives after the map is built. The suite
///   `transform_stylex_keyframes_test::shared_function_map` measures that, with
///   calls standing between the import and the call that reads it.
/// - **`env` is one object for the file.** `build_rule_call_eval_config` folds
///   `apply_stylex_env` into the map, and `CoreStyleXOptions::env` is read-only
///   once the options are built, so a second call cannot be handed a map built
///   from a different env. `the_env_survives_into_every_map_the_module_asks_-
///   for` measures that every map the module asks for still carries it.
///

/// and the answer would be to key the cache on it rather than on `helpers`
